# TablaRasa
##Description
Ruby code for creating tabla compositions, for practice or performance. There are also tools that allow for markov analysis of tabla compositions
as well as creating new compositions based on the markov analysis of other works. The quickest way to get started is to run the "TablaRasa_usage_examples.rb" file. It will go through a basic usage sequence for the software.

##ToDo
* Increase the depth of the markov analysis.
* Create graph output for time dependant XYZ plane graphing
* Include midi support for computer performance of generated compositions

## Usage Examples

## Graph Example
This is an example of the graph output using [Rub-Graphiz](https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz/)
